<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>RyRFit is a program designed to place boxes with the correct dimensions and orientation
at the positions of RyR tetramers in tomographic images of dyads of mammalian cardiomyocytes.
The images, which  are in the TIFF format, consist of sequential parallel planes, betwen 0.5
and 1 nm apart, through the plane of the dyad and are generated by the Amira program (Thermo
Fisher Scientific - FEI). The tetramer is represented by an open rectangle with a default width
of 27 nm (which can be changed).</p>
<p>This program is used in conjunction with the multiview function of Amira to provide an
estimate of the tetramers position and orientation and to distinguish between coated membrane   
areas and the tetramers.</p>
<p>Tetramers are placed manually and can then be classified according to the scheme in
Asghari et. al. Circ. Res. 115(2) 252-66, 2014. The program also calculates nearest
neighbour distances as well as an alpha shape and a convex hull around the dyad, allowing
and estimate of the area and the density (tetramers per unit area).
</p>
<p>Tetramer information (position, orientation, classification) is saved in the {fn_}tetramer.dat file where fn is the name 
of the image file. NND data is saved in {fn_}nnd.dat

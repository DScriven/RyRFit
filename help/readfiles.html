<h2 id="readfiles">Reading in the image files</h2>
<p>There are two modes for reading in files:</p> 
<ul><li>A single file containing multiple images - default</li>
<li>Multiple images of single planes (Image stack)</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="Input_choice.png"></center>
<p>After choosing the input mode you initiate the read by clicking on the open file/directory icon.</p> 
<center><img src="browser_icon.jpg"></center>
<p>This icon allows the image file/directory to be chosen. If this icon is
pressed after an image has been loaded it will terminate the analysis and save the tetramer data 
associated with that image and load whatever image is chosen next. This allows different images to be
processed in the same instance of the program</p>
<h3 id="multipleimages">Reading in a single multi-image dataset</h3>
<p>In this case you use the browser icon to select a single image.</p>
<center><img src="MultiStackImage_step2.png"></center>
<p>On selection, the system searches for the file {fn_}tetramer.dat and reads it in if it is present.
If there is no tetramer file it will ask you for the image scaling. Entering and modifying the scaling 
is described <a href="./imagescale.html">here</a>.
Display of the image and any previously loaded tetramers occurs when 'Load & Display" is pressed.</p>
<h3 id="image stack">Reading in an image stack</h3> 
Image stacks are assumed to consist of multiple images of approximately the same size which are 
read in in numerical order.  For this reason it is only necessary to use the browse icon to 
identify the directory which contains the files. It is assumed that this directory contains no TIFF images 
other those in the image stack. In this case, {fn_} is set to NULL and the files saved are named tetramer.dat
and nnd.dat
</p>
<center><img src="Input Stack directory.png"></center>
<p>Selecting the directory name automatically lists the files to be read in, in numerical order,
and reads in any existing {fn_}tetramer.dat file, as seen in the image below.</p>
<center><img src="ImageStack_step2.png"></center>
<p>If there is no tetramer file it will ask you for the image scaling if you haven't entered it
previously. Entering and modifying the scaling is described <a href="./imagescale.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Pressing 'Load & display' will read in and display images and any previously saved tetramers. 
Adding, modifying, deleting and classification of the tetramers is described <a href="./addmodify.html">here</a></p> 
<p>NOTE: An image which was originally analysed as a multi-image file which is then displayed as a single multilayer imagetack
may be inverted compared to the original multi-image file. If the saved tetramers do not coincide with the image use
the F12 key to flip the image and bring them back into register</p>

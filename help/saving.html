<p>The NND values can be displayed and saved at any time by pressing F10.</p>
<p>The {fn_}tetramer.dat and {fn_}nnd.dat files can be saved manually by using the F5 key, displaying the results on the screen. 
Pressing any one of the following keys or icons: 'Esc', 'Close',the file/directory browser or changing the input mode 
will automatically calculate and display the NND's and areas and save the two files. The results will be displayed in the 
text box.'Esc' and 'Close' will ask you if you really want to leave the program. If no changes are made to the tetramers 
between the load and exit, the F5 and the other keys/icons will have no effect on the output files.</p>

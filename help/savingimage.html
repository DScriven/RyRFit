<h2>Saving the fitted image</h2>
<p>The image with the selected tetramers can be saved as a screenshot.
<b>F7</b> saves a copy of the image as it appears on the screen. The resolution of the TIFF image (dpi) is the same as the 
screen dpi. The name of the image is {fn_}fitted.tif when the input image is a single multiimage file and fitted.tif when it is 
a stack of TIFF images. To prevent overwriting, each subsequent saved image name has _n appended where n is a number counting 
the saved images.</p>  
<h3 id="scalebar">Adding a scale bar</h3>
<p>To add a scale bar to the press <b>F6</b> which brings up a box allowing the user to enter the length of the scale bar in nanometers. 
Position the cursor to where the left bottom corner of the scale bar is to be placed and press the center mouse button. If the scale bar 
is in the wrong position pressing <b>F6</b> removes it and press <b>F6</b> again to restart the process.</p>
